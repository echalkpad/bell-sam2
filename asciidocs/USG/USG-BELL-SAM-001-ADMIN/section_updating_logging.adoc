== Updating logging for a docker container or java process

In order to change the logging for a docker container/java process the log4j2.xml file in that container needs to be updated. 
To do this please follow these steps

. log onto the machine where the docker container is running
. docker ps <- this should list the id of the container you want to update the file in
. docker exec -it <container id> bash
. edit the file using vi /opt/vennetics/sam/config/log4j2.xml

This does not effect the logging on any other running container.
