= Intro

The core-cassandra project implements AOP methods to wrap all I/O `CrudRepository` calls in Hystrix Commands. +
Examples of this can be found: +
core-cassandra/src/main/java/com.vennetics.bell.sam.core.cassandra

= Core-Cassandra Dependency

Add `core-cassandra` as a dependency in your project to auto-generate the wrapping of I/O in Hystrix. Any interfaces
that implement `CrudRepository` will be automatically picked up by core-cassandra's CrudRepositoryAdvice class.

= Result

Applications that use Spring-Data and specifically implement a `CrudRepository` will be wrapped in Hystrix
and displayed in the Hystrix-Dashboard.
