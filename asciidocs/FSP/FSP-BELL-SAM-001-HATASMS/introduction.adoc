== Introduction

This document describes the Service API Mediation (SAM) OneAPI service that provides a SMS
messaging capability using the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) capability.

This platform will be built using the Vennetics J-Box infrastructure, however,
unlike existing Bell deployments it will be built as a suite of micro-services
hosted within docker containers on the Bell mobility cloud network.

The diagram below provides a high-level logical architecture for this component.

This FSP focusses specifically on the HATA SMS micro-service and its functional
interfaces.

*Note:* it is not the intent of this document to repeat information already available in the API specification xref:References[[1]].
This document should therefore be read in conjunction with the spec.
