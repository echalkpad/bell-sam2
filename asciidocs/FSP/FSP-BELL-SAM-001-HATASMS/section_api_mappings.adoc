== API Mappings

This section details how requests and responses on the RESTful API are mapped to
SMPP requests and responses to the SMS-C.

Note: Not all payloads supported by the API are described in this section. Only
those that have a mapping to or from the SMPP protocol.

=== OutboundSMSMessageRequest

Outbound SMS Message Request is used to send a binary message to the SMS-C.
These messages are mapped to the submit_sm operation.

[options="header"]
|=======================
|From: | to: SMPP submit_sm
|address[] | destination_addr

One submit_sm will be sent for each address. Multi-cast will not be used.

Only tel URIs compliant with RFC3966 will be accepted by the API.
|senderAddress| source_addr

For this API only short-codes will be allowed by the service.
The "short:" scheme defined within the NET API common standards should be used for this field. It is anticipated short-codes could be any length from 3 to 15 characters. But will never be 10 digits. Short codes must contain numbers only. Alphabetical characters, pluses, and punctuation won't be accepted.

e.g. short:123456

Short-codes will be passed through to the SMS-C as supplied if all validation checks pass.

[[OutboundSMSBinaryMessage]]
=== OutboundSMSBinaryMessage

[options="header"]
|=======================
|From: | to: SMPP submit_sm
|message |message_payload

No transformation will be applied to the message payload other than encoding it into the PDU.
The TPA should specify the request payload in 8-bit binary format, and this will
be written in the same format to the SMS PDU.
A max payload of 64K will be supported.
|=======================

=== InboundSMSMessageRequest

Inbound SMS Message Request is used to deliver a mobile originated (MO) message
from the SMS-C to a TPA. These messages are mapped from the deliver_sm
operation.


[options="header"]
|=======================
|From: deliver_sm | to:
|destination_addr |destinationAddress[]

Each message will be delivered individually so this field will only contain a single address.
|source_addr |senderAddress
If not sent by the SMS-C this field will be an empty URI.
| message_payload |message

Since the RESTful API uses an xsd:string rather than xsd:base64Binary for this type the SAM platform will encode the message_payload contents as Base64 manually.
| - |dateTime
Created by SAM when delivering the message.

|=======================

=== DeliveryInfo

DeliveryInfo is used to notify a TPA of the current status of a submitted MT
message. These messages are mapped from the submit_sm_resp and deliver_sm
operations.


[options="header"]
|=======================
|From: submit_sm_resp |to:DeliveryInfo
| - |address[]

Each message will be delivered individually so this field will only contain a single address."
|command_status |deliveryStatus

0 DeliveredToNetwork*

|message_id| -
|=======================

*Note:* a *successful* submit_sm_resp will not trigger a notification to the
application as itâ€™s an intermediary state.

[options="header"]
|=======================
|From: deliver_sm |to:DeliveryInfo
|destination_addr |address[]

Each message will be delivered individually so this field will only contain a single address.
| |deliveryStatus

Set to DeliveredToTerminal when the deliver_sm operation is received.
