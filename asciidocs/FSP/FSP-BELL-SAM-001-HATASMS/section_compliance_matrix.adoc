=== Mime Types

The following MIME types are supported as request and response payloads.

* application/json
* application/xml

Standard HTML practices for content negotiation will be used in determining the MIME
type to use in requests and responses.

* Clients must include a Content-Type header in all requests containing a message payload.
* Clients should include an Accept header to specify their desired response MIME type.
If this header is not present the service will default to application/xml in responses
regardless of submitted content-type.
