== State Diagrams

This section summarises the state diagrams for the core messaging use cases.

=== MT Send Message and Status Notification No Retry

include::diagram_state_mt_send_message_no_retry.adoc[]

The diagram above shows the standard state transitions when no retry is requested.

=== MT Send Message and Status Notification With Retry Requested

include::diagram_state_mt_send_message_with_retry.adoc[]

The diagram above shows the standard state transitions when HATA SMS Retry (either
via configuration or API) is requested. The key differences from the standard
model are:

. A retry timer is initiated on acceptance of the TPAâ€™s request.
. If a retry timer fires the message is re-submitted regardless of state.
. When no retries remain and the message has been submitted the service will wait for a configurable timeout for the delivery notification.
. The TPA is only notified of the message state when one of the three terminating states is entered.

=== MO Message Delivery (push mode)

include::diagram_state_mo_push.adoc[]

The diagram above shows the standard state transitions for pushing messages to
the TPA. The key points to note are:

. The message is not stored for future polling.
. The message handling will complete regardless of successful notification.
