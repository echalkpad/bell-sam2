= Introduction

The Bell Sam Admin Service exposes REST Api's for CRUD on the Bell Sam Cassandra Entities.

.Admin Service APIs include:
* CassandraAllowedService CRUD
* CassandraApplication CRUD
* CassandraClient CRUD
* CassandraPolicyType CRUD
* CassandraProtocolType CRUD
* CassandraRole CRUD
* CassandraServiceType CRUD

The Bell Sam Application Admin Service exposes REST Api's which enable higher level modification of Applications' abstracting away some of the low level cassandra CRUD calls.

.Application Admin Service APIs include:
* getAllApplications
* createApplication
* getApplicationById
* deleteApplication
* updateApplication
* addService
* deleteService
* addRole
* deleteRole
* getAllServiceTypes
* getAllRoles
* addApplicationPolicy
* deleteApplicationPolicy
* addServicePolicy
* deleteServicePolicy
* getAllProtocolTypes
* getAllPolicyTypes

The Bell Sam User details service exposes read-only operations for use by internal security APIs

.User details APIs include:
* loadByClientId

= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs
The SubX service adheres to REST standards.
|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, full updates only

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes
The Bell Sam DB Admin Service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
 The actual response will depend on the request method used.
 In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
 In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or
deceptive request routing).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

| `503 Service Unavailable`
| The request could not be processed due to a downstream system failure.
